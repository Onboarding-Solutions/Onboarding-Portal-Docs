# Onboarding-Portal-Docs

Welcome to the **Onboarding-Portal-Docs** project documentation platform! This repository serves as a central place where we document key aspects of our team's development activities.

## Overview
- **Team Development Notes**: We keep track of our project progress, discussions, and other relevant information here.
- **API Documentation**: Our API documentation is also included in this repository.

Currently, we are using Markdown files to document everything directly in this GitHub repository. 

Please note that this is a temporary setup. I plan to migrate this content to another platform or establish an online documentation site for easier access and preview in the near future.

**Important:** All commits in this repository are made directly to the main branch, with no additional branches. Every team member is encouraged to commit their changes directly.
